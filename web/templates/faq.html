              That's a bit painful. Yes, you can get this to work, ideally with
              the DietPi based image - which of course makes setting up WiFi a
              bit more challenging. Additionally, I'd suggest getting it work
              reliably just with some (or all) of the 'semi anonymous'
              aggregators (so the first dozen or so in the list that are all
              served by the same container on the feeder). And only adding
              FlightAware, FlightRadar, Radarbox, and the other aggregators
              below them one by one once you are happy that this still isn't
              overwhelming your little SBC. Generally SBCs with 1GB (or more) of
              memory create better results with this setup.

                No, this will not work reliably with just a USB charger.
                Or a USB cable from a powered hub. Or whatever. Yes, that other guy on Discord said... The reality is
                that the vast majority of issues when running this image on a single board computer can be traced back
                to bad power. So before you ask for help, please ask yourself "am I using a decent power supply?".
                At least a 5V/2.5A power supply for an RPi3-class SBC, 5V/4A or better for anything more powerful than
                that.

                If this doesn't work, I really recommend simply starting again.
                Download the image, use the Pi Imager or a similar bit-accurate
                program to write the image to the SD-card. Make
                sure you don't skip the verify step. Then turn off the SBC,
                insert the SD-card and turn it back on again. Be patient - wait

              virtual disk image, as well as a version prepared for (relatively)
              easy installation with ProxMox. Please note that when opening the
              OVA in VMware (Fusion/Workstation/whatever) you will get an error
              on the first attempt, but will be able to succesfully import it if
              you click 'Retry'. Make sure you pass your SDR through to the VM -
              this works differently in each hypervisor, so please look at your
              specific hypervisor software for instructions. Look for an option
              to make host USB devices available to the VM. There are some
              noticeable issues with mlat when running the Feeder Image in a VM.

                ADS-B Feeder. After a few moments you should see the new network
                member show up on the Network Settings panel on the Zerotier
                website. There you accept the feeder into your network and give
                it a name. Also note down the IP address that it is assigned in

              This is actually a surprisingly complex question. The ADS-B Feeder
              Image provided here (or installed as an 'app' in DietPi or on a
              different Linux OS) is Docker based. And it runs a Python/Flask
              app to provide the web user interface. This by definition creates
              overhead. It will use more memory than an optimized minimal
              installation of the necessary software directly on the SBC OS.
              Given that I have tried to be careful in how I set things up, the
              difference isn't very big, but it's there, and especially on a low
              memory device (e.g., a 512MB RPi Zero2W or RPi 3a) that difference
              can be significant. On the flip side, the moment you consider
              submitting your data to more than one aggregator, the equation
              changes. This is where having a setup like this one really helps
              to keep things simple. The other situation where the ADS-B Feeder
              Image has a significant edge over installation directly on an SBC
              is for anyone who isn't super comfortable with the command line,
              who doesn't want to spend a lot of time in a text editor or
              entering commands in a terminal window, and who is looking for an
              easy to use user interface. The ADS-B Feeder Image is primarily
              designed to be easy, to appeal to people who aren't super
              comfortable running a Linux system. Interestingly enough, quite a
              few very experienced folks still decide to use this image simply
              because of the UI and the simplicity - but I understand if you
              feel differently and don't need the helping hand. In summary: yes,
              there is additional overhead, but in most situations it's academic
              and doesn't really make an difference. If you have an SBC with a
              gigabyte or more, it's likely not relevant. But if you aren't a
              fan of the Linux command line, this may still be a very powerful
              option to consider.
