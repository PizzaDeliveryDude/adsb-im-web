              That's a bit painful. Yes, you can get this to work, ideally with
              the DietPi based image - which of course makes setting up WiFi a
              bit more challenging. Additionally, I'd suggest getting it work
              reliably just with some (or all) of the 'semi anonymous'
              aggregators (so the first dozen or so in the list that are all
              served by the same container on the feeder). And only adding
              FlightAware, FlightRadar, Radarbox, and the other aggregators
              below them one by one once you are happy that this still isn't
              overwhelming your little SBC. Generally SBCs with 1GB (or more) of
              memory create better results with this setup. <br />
              But really, the better solution here is a <a href="/stage2">two stage setup</a>.

              There are many ways to interpret this question. I'll assume you want to know what's a good setup to run.
              And surprisingly, that's a complicated questions. It depends on a lot of factors. <br />
              Do you just want to run a simple feeder that feeds some / many / most / all of the aggregators?<br />
              The best bet right now might be a Raspberry Pi 4 with 1G or 2G of memory. Those are once again reasonably
              easy to get, not too expensive, and more than capable enough to run all this.<br />
              I have a smaller / cheaper SBC - will that also work?<br />
              The Raspberry Pi 3 is known to have a bunch of problems that cause occasional MLAT hiccups. Similarly, the
              Pi Zero 2 does work, but it's not great. The Libre Computing Le Potato and the Orange Pi Zero 3 seem to be
              good slightly cheaper choices. For all of the boards that are have less than 1G of RAM or significantly
              slower CPUs than the Raspberry Pi 4, a <a href="/stage2">two stage setup</a> might be the best
              option. A (hopefully) current list of supported hardware can be found on our <a
                 href="/supported">Supported
                Hardware</a> page.<br />
              What about x86?<br />
              64bit Thin Clients (often available for very little money on eBay) are a great choice. Anything more
              powerful will work as well, but might be a bit of a waste (just like running this on a Raspberry Pi 5 or
              an Orange Pi 5 is definitely overkill). Stage 2 instances work great in x86_64 VMs (that's kind of the
              sweet spot for them, really), but running the feeder itself (i.e. the system with the SDR attached) in a
              VM creates problems with MLAT because of USB passthrough challenges.

                No, this will not work reliably with just a USB charger.
                Or a USB cable from a powered hub. Or whatever. Yes, that other guy on Discord said... The reality is
                that the vast majority of issues when running this image on a single board computer can be traced back
                to bad power. So before you ask for help, please ask yourself "am I using a decent power supply?".
                At least a 5V/2.5A power supply for an RPi3-class SBC, 5V/4A or better for anything more powerful than
                that.

                Ideally this should work out of the box. But in practice

                If this doesn't work, I really recommend simply starting again.
                Download the image, use the Pi Imager or a similar bit-accurate
                program to write the image to the SD-card. Make
                sure you don't skip the verify step. Then turn off the SBC,
                insert the SD-card and turn it back on again. Be patient - wait
                at least several minutes, longer, if it is an "install-on-boot"
                image, marked as "iob" in the image name. Now check again at

              We provide an OVA for each release, also simply a compressed

              easy installation with ProxMox. Please note that when opening the

              you click 'Retry'. Make sure you pass your SDR through to the VM -
              this works differently in each hypervisor, so please look at your
              specific hypervisor software for instructions. Look for an option

                member show up on the Network Settings panel on the Zerotier
                website. There you accept the feeder into your network and give
                it a name. Also note down the IP address that it is assigned in

                Once that is done, you can access your feeder from that other
                device (cell phone, laptop, whatever) by using the IP address
                you noted down earlier.

              This is actually a surprisingly complex question. The ADS-B Feeder
              Image provided here (or installed as an 'app' in DietPi or on a
              different Linux OS) is Docker based. And it runs a Python/Flask
              app to provide the web user interface. This by definition creates
              overhead. It will use more memory than an optimized minimal
              installation of the necessary software directly on the SBC OS.
              Given that I have tried to be careful in how I set things up, the
              difference isn't very big, but it's there, and especially on a low
              memory device (e.g., a 512MB RPi Zero 2 W or RPi 3 A+) that difference
              can be significant. On the flip side, the moment you consider
              submitting your data to more than one aggregator, the equation
              changes. This is where having a setup like this one really helps
              to keep things simple. The other situation where the ADS-B Feeder
              Image has a significant edge over installation directly on an SBC
              is for anyone who isn't super comfortable with the command line,
              who doesn't want to spend a lot of time in a text editor or
              entering commands in a terminal window, and who is looking for an
              easy to use user interface. The ADS-B Feeder Image is primarily
              designed to be easy, to appeal to people who aren't super
              comfortable running a Linux system. Interestingly enough, quite a
              few very experienced folks still decide to use this image simply
              because of the UI and the simplicity - but I understand if you
              feel differently and don't need the helping hand. In summary: yes,
              there is additional overhead, but in most situations it's academic
              and doesn't really make an difference. If you have an SBC with a
              gigabyte or more, it's likely not relevant. But if you aren't a
              fan of the Linux command line, this may still be a very powerful
              option to consider.
