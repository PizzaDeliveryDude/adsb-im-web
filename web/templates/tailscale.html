    <h4 class="mt-2">What is Tailscale?</h4>
    <div class="col-12">Tailscale is one of several "free for personal use" site-to-site networking services (also known
      as VPN, Virtual Local Network and other confusing terms). Essentially, it allows you to connect multiple computers
      that can talk to each other as if they were on the same LAN, even if they are not and are in fact thousands of
      kilometers apart. This works through typical home network setups without any configuration changes and on most
      public networks. Corporate networks may have controls in place that prevent services like this from working.
    </div>
    <h4 class="mt-2">How do I set this up?</h4>
    <div class="col-12">First, this is not sponsored content. I get nothing for linking to them, none of the links here
      are affiliate links (I don't even know if they have that). This is simply a service that is based on open source
      technology, run by people I trust reasonably well, and it's super easy for non-techies to get going. </div>
    <div class="col-12">With that out of the way, go to the <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale website</a> and
      create an account (that's the "Get Started" button). This is easiest if you simply link to your existing Gmail,
      GitHub, or Apple ID.</div>
    <div class="col-12">Once that is done, you'll be at a page where it asks you to set up your first system. BEFORE you
      do that, very important, go to their <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/billing/plans">Billing
        Plans</a> page, ignore all the nice big options to give them money, and at the bottom center click on "Choose
      our personal plan". This will get you a popup to acknowledge the limitation. Be warned, if you want to deploy more
      than 99 feeders, this may be too restrictive ðŸ¤£.</div>
    <div class="col-12">Now go back to <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines">Machines</a> and click on
      "Add Device". This will allow you to set up Tailscale on the computer that you are using to connect to the
      website. I recommend NOT doing this on your phone - that is possible, but a bit... painful to manage things
      with... a Windows / Mac / Linux system is the much better choice.</div>
    <h4 class="mt-2">How do I connect my {% if 'adsb.im' in x_forwarded_host %}ADSB.im{% else %}SDRE.im{% endif %} feeder?</h4>
    <div class="col-12">On the feeder homepage, select "Management" und der "System" menu item. There at the bottom
      you'll find the option to add this feeder to a tailnet (the network you created in the previous step). Click on
      the "Submit" button in the Add Tailscale section. This will reload the page and (once you scroll down again)
      present you with a link to log in. Click the link, sign in with the same account, and click on "Connect".
    </div>
    <div class="col-12">That's it, you should be done.
