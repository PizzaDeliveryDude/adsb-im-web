            <p>This Privacy Notice is to inform EU and U.K. citizens who use ADSB.im how their personal information is
                used.</p>
            <p>The only information this site receives from you before you configure your system are the local IP
                address of the network your ADS-B Feeder is connected to, and the public IP address of the system from
                which you access this server. These two addresses are associated with each other in order to enable the
                forwarding service to your board during installation. The data is automatically deleted after 60
                seconds.</p>
            <p>Once the adsb.im feeder image is up and running, it will connect to the adsb.im server when displaying
                the feeder homepage. It sends the current version of the adsb.im feeder image, the board name, and a
                random identifier to the backend server in order to enable the <em>update</em> notifications and very
                coarse statistics. Again, the server retains no user or system identifiable data based on this
                information, no actual logs of the access, neither the IP address used, nor any other user / system
                specific data.
                Instead, it simply hashes the data in order to provide the developers a rough idea of the number of
                users per board / platform / version.</p>
            <p>Since the update feature is one of the core values of the feeder image, the user cannot opt out of this
                data being sent (other than simply not using the image.</p>
            <p>The site is run on a server located in the US, managed by an individual located in the US. Contact for
                questions about data handling and privacy is dirk@dh-consulting.io.</p>
            <p>Post mail: ADSB.im Data Protection Lead, c/o DH Consulting, 12725 SW Millikan Way, #300 Beaverton, OR
                97005 USA.</p>
            <p>With the GDPR compliance out of the way, here is the summary that applies to everyone (since we don't
                actually track where you are from): It’s simple. We do not use your data. We do not care who your
                friends are. We do not intend to market to you or to do anything else that’s annoying. There is no
                monetization and no other use or processing of your data - we only store it very briefly with the
                purpose of simplifying the setup of your device. All user specific data outside the above mentioned
                anonymous statistics is deleted after at most 60 seconds.</p>
            <p>Obviously, your ADS-B Feeder image will connect to other cloud services, including but not limited to
                any aggregator that you enable, the Debian APT repositories for the underlying OS, Github.com, and
                container registries. These services are unrelated to adsb.im and they are provided under their own
                license or use terms, privacy policies, and data use policies.</p>
