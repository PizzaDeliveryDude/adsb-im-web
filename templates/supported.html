                <b>Most importantly</b>: you need a decent power supply. No, not a USB charger. An actual power supply
                designed for a single board computer. For most RPi3 class boards you can get away with a 5V/2.5A
                powersupply. For anything more powerful I recommend a 5V/4A power supply.<br />
                Boards that are actively tested and should work:
                <ul>
                    <li>Raspberry Pi4 or Pi5 (the Pi5 certainly is overkill, a Pi4 with 2G RAM will do just fine)</li>
                    <li>OrangePi Zero 3 (currently my favorite when it comes to price / performance)</li>
                    <li>Raspberry Pi Zero 2, 3a/b (note that a Raspberry Pi Zero W will NOT work; also, we are
                        investigating some MLAT instability with Pi3 models, so potentially not the best choice)</li>
                    <li>Libre Computing Le Potato</li>
                    <li>Orange Pi 3LTS (no wifi support), 4LTS, 5, and 5plus (these are all known to work, but not
                        tested regularly)</li>
                </ul>
                Additionally, the software stack can be installed on any board that supports DietPi, and even on most
                Debian or Ubuntu Linux systems. Please note that installing the adsb.im software in a VM is known to
                cause MLAT issues when the USB SDR is passed through to the VM.

                    <li>You'll get by far the best results with an outdoor antenna mounted as high as possible (for good
                        visibility to the horizon)</li>

                    <li>especially when investing in the Airspy Mini and a good outdoor antenna, a filtered LNA is a
                        very useful addition. Again, great info on <a

            <div class="mb-2" id="sdcards">SD cards (well, technically ÂµSD cards)
                <ul>
                    <li>While the software fits on an 8GB card, it's generally better to go for a larger card as that
                        extends the useful life of the card. Flash cells have a limited amount of write cycles and a
                        larger card will balance the writes across more cells. The software stack tries to reduce
                        unnecessary writes, but we still see especially 8GB cards die fairly regularly.</li>
                    <li>Ideally you want a class 10 card from a name brand. ScanDisk Ultra have been known to be
                        reliable</li>
                    <li>Many other brands also have decent cards - but shy away from anything where the price is too
                        good to be true</li>
                    <li>Personally, for most of my feeders I use 64GB SanDisk Extreme cards - others have been very
                        happy with the SanDisk Industrial and Samsung High Endurance cards.</li>
